# edgeg.io-atom-time-plugin package

GTM, or GIT Time Metrics, is a utility that tracks activity on files that
are part of a GIT repository and aggregates that activity into useful time
information. It tracks this time through the use of editor plugins and by
using GIT post-commit hooks. These timings and data are stored in the local
GIT repo in GIT notes. This plugin will track this data for projects that are
edited with the Atom editor.

# Configuration

* Use GTM - Set this to TRUE if you have GTM installed and want to track metrics
locally.
* Location of GTM executable - Set this to the path where the gtm
executable is installed. Atom does not have access to your shell, so this
must be set explicitly.

# Requirements

In order to utilize this plugin, you must have the GTM agent installed on
your computer. For more details on how to install the GTM agent, please
visit [the GTM Homepage](http://dogsbuttbrew.com/gtm).
