## 0.1.0 - First Release
* Initial revision

This is the initial revision. It requires that an Influxtime agent is
installed on your machine and the "influxtime" application is in the system
path somewhere.

## 0.1.1 - Bug Fix
* Fixed bug where _influxmetric_ command cannot be found when launched from the
finder. A future release will present the user with a setting to set this.
